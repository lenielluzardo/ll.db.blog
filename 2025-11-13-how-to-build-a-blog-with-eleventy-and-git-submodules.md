Hello my fellow developer, hope you're doing well so far.
So, you're just like me a couple of days ago. I was surfing the web looking for options to build my blog, but the stuning amount of option led me to give up a couple of times before even starting.

I was asking to my self: Should I buil it with React? maybe with Angular? what about ASP.NET? if I use just vanilla Javascript? 🫠

I wanted something that was elegant, fast, and without the complexity of a whole brick framework. I wanted something that was fun to build but at the same time not too complex to read about it an entire week.

So after comparing all the options and reading some opinions on forums and youtube comments. I had to choose. Like the saying goes "after while it doesn't matter what side of the fence do you pick, just get off"

And I came with a special unicorn (new to me) that made things "smoooth operator🎷🎷". And that was: Using Eleventy + Github submodules + Netlify. And ta-dah! a one day build blog post that is fast, elegant and fun to build...

So if you want to give it a try this are the steps that I follow to achieve that:

## Step 1: Eleventy.
*In progress*

## Step 2: Git Submodules (with Github).
*In progress*

## Step 3: Netlify deploy.
*In progress*

## Conclusion.
I was spiraling around trying to choose the latest trends and following  the industry patterns that I was used to. But that stoped me from growing (Don't let that happend to you). Don't be afraid to try new things, don't focus on making it perfect and think first on the actual purpose/goal and not the tools or trends. For the rest, Eleventy, Netlify and Github are great optionis, I recommend them, they have a very well integration workflow that made things easy to work with and to have a live website in matter of hours, even minutes.
